#Info 201 Project Proposal
_Author: Clayton Chen, Jessie Yang, Sean Yang, Velocity Yu_
## Project Description
___
###What is the dataset we'll be working with?
>
We are working with the World Development Indicator dataset collected by the World Bank*, more specifically,. The data can be accessed at the  [link](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators). 
>
*The World Bank is an international financial institution that provides loan to countries of the world for capital projects. Their goal is to reduce poverty of the world and support development. 


###Who is our target audience? 
>
Our target audience is economics students and most of the political science students, since the indicators we choose to reflect the development of the country is relative to their school works. However, we strongly welcome all of the interested one to explore our project!

###What does the audience want to learn from your data?

>
- GDP per capita && GDP (current US$) for the whole world from 1960 - 2016
- What is the income group that each country should be categorised in?
- What is the relationship between two indicators for a country?
- How does each countryâ€™s economy grow overtime (GDP trend)?
- Compare indicators growth overtime between multiple countries

###How will we be reading in our data.
>
We will read in our data by using the WDICountry.csv and WDIData.csv files downloaded from the  link : https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators

###What types of data-wrangling will we need to do to our data?
>
We are going to reshape and filter the data down by choosing different economic tools and indexes and countries.

###What are the steps to form the projecft?
>
1. Extract the useful data from different databases.
2. Reformat and write data to a new .csv file to process.
3. Make plots using the data.
4. Make a shiny app to show the skeleton of the project.
5. Integrate all the data and app into a .Rmd file and form a .html file.

###What libraries will be used in this project?
>
plotly, ggplot2, dplyr, shiny, DT

###Whar are the major challenges in the project for us?
>
It is hard for us to manipulate all the data since it involves two data set and one of it is extremely large. It will be hard for us to extract useful data from the whole file.
